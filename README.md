# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains a collection of practical projects covering core algorithms and methods in Artificial Intelligence. Each notebook focuses on a specific AI paradigm such as search, constraint satisfaction, probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, or reinforcement learning. The aim is to build a foundational understanding of AI by implementing algorithms and applying them to real datasets like DNA sequences or structured logic problems.

## üß† Supported AI Algorithms

### üîç 1. Systematic Search
Implemented: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
Used to solve the classic **Missionaries and Cannibals** problem by exploring the full state space and enforcing safety constraints.

### ‚úÖ 2. Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
Implemented on: **Sudoku**, **Cryptarithmetic Puzzles**  
- Backtracking Search  
- Forward Checking  
- Domain Reduction  
- Heuristics (MRV, Degree Heuristic)

### ‚öîÔ∏è 3. Adversarial Search
Implemented on: **Othello (Reversi)**, **Kingdom Conflict: Eldora**  
- **Minimax Algorithm**  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**  
- Game tree modeling  
- Custom evaluation functions (e.g., mobility, stability, control)

### üìà 4. Machine Learning for Classification
Applied to: **DNA Classification**  
Models used:
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

Each model was trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and relevant bioinformatics datasets.

### üìä 5. Bayesian Networks
Used for: **Probabilistic reasoning on DNA datasets**  
- Graph-based structure (DAG)  
- Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)  
- Evidence-based inference  
Useful for predicting missing gene values or estimating likelihoods in biological systems.

### üéÆ 6. Reinforcement Learning
Implemented: **Q-Learning**  
Applied to the **FrozenLake-v1** environment (OpenAI Gym) to train an agent that learns optimal actions in a slippery 4√ó4 grid world.  
Key components:
- Q-table learning
- Œµ-greedy exploration
- Performance tracking over episodes
